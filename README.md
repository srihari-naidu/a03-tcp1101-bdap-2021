# Basic Data Analysis Program (B.D.A.P)

The purpose of this project is to create a console-based, easy-to-use basic data analysis system. For this project, Iâ€™ve used C++ and a text file database.

## Features

- Generate a HTML or a text report
- Statistical computation for each row and column
- Easy-to-use console-based interface
- Basic data analysis functionalities

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the program
```
g++ main.cpp -o BDAP
```
3. Run the program in your UNIX terminal
```
./BDAP
```

## Usage

1. Choose to generate a HTML or a text report
2. Input the file name of the data file
3. Input the number of rows and columns in the data file
4. Input the data values
5. The statistical computation for each row and column will be displayed
6. The report will be generated in HTML format and automatically opened in your default browser
